# Problem Statement
# Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program should perform the following tasks:

# Prompt the user to enter the first number.

# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

# Prompt the user to enter the second number.

# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers.

# Print the total sum with an appropriate message.

# The provided solution demonstrates a working implementation of this problem, where the main() function guides the user through the process of entering two numbers and displays their sum.


# """
# Program: add2numbers
# --------------------
# Another python program to get some practice with
# variables.  This program asks the user for two
# integers and prints their sum.
